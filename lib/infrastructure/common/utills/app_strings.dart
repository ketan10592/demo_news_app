This isnâ€™t an act of vandalism, you understand, but rather a precursor to building an enormous solar power plant that surrounds its entire host star. What else would an ambitious alien society do to continue its expansion? How else would it meet its ever-increasing demand for energy?\n\nThis scenario, or something like it, is the founding principle of the search for alien megastructures, which in this case would look something like dark embers when viewed through infrared telescopes. The search began in 1960, when physicist Freeman Dyson proposed it as a way of finding alien life. More than 60 years later, the hunt for Dyson spheres, as they are now known, remains a minority sport among those involved in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), an enterprise that has focused primarily on listening for radio signals from other worlds.';
